# students-spring-service

This repo is based on a course follow-along codebase. The initial implementation is based on the course, but additional refactors and features are being considered

Goals of this repo are:

- Getting familiar with the Spring framework
- Getting familiar with Java
- Getting familiar with Back-end technologies and architecture
